                <p>
                    It started with the <a href="https://medium.com/sketchware/what-is-sketchware-e19aa55b4c7c" target="_blank">Sketchware</a>, which was an android based block programming IDE for building apps. I built various 2D games and tools with it, some of which were featured on their store. A start that still inspire me every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explore new areas, I contributed to SWViewer, a counter vandalism tool that helps Wikipedia contributors monitor edits in real-time. It was my first real step into web technologies, where I designed and built the frontend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience led me to start working on my own communication app called <a href="https://cinny.in" target="_blank">Cinny</a>, built on the <a href="https://matrix.org" target="_blank">Matrix</a> protocol. What began as a side project quickly gained attention and recognition - including being featured by <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/" target="_blank">matrix.org</a>. Later I joined <a href="https://element.io" target="_blank">Element</a>, the creators of Matrix, where I worked for nearly two years on <a href="https://thirdroom.io" target="_blank">Third Room</a>, a metaverse project built on Matrix, with an incredible team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, I continue to develop Cinny and ecosystem around it, including a custom design system called <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/folds" target="_blank">Folds</a>, all available at <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp" target="_blank">github.com/cinnyapp</a>. My focus is on building web-first experiences using React, TypeScript, and CSS, while also exploring backend technologies like Go and Rust to broaden my skill set. I care deeply about how products feel, both visually and functionally and I enjoy bridging the gap between design and engineering using tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Draw.io.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside from programming I really enjoy cycling, exploring music and movies, and observing how design, behavior, and culture evolve around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to <a href="mailto:ajbura@gmail.com">email</a> me or reach out on Matrix (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ajbura:matrix.org" target="_blank">@ajbura:matrix.org</a>) - I'm always open to a good conversation.
